Welcome to my CSE 165 Final Project!

There are no special instructions to run this game, as no additional libraries have been installed. Simply type make in the terminal, and then ./glutapp. 
The game can lag between levels, but it shouldn't take more than a couple seconds for the game to run. I hope you enjoy!
